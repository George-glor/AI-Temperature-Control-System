# AI-Driven Temperature Control System

This repository contains an AI-driven system for maintaining indoor comfort while optimizing energy efficiency. The project leverages machine learning and real-time weather data to dynamically adjust indoor temperature.

---

## Features
- **Indoor Temperature Prediction**: Uses real-time weather data (humidity, wind speed, pressure) to predict indoor temperature.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts heating or cooling to maintain a stable indoor temperature around 20Â°C.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Fetches live weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.

---

## Project Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains historical weather data for model training.
- **`model/`**: Saved machine learning models in `.pkl` format.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for training, preprocessing, and real-time implementation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and model development.

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Historical weather data.
   - Real-time updates from OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Models evaluated: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso.
   - Best model: Random Forest for real-time predictions.
3. **Real-Time Implementation**:
   - Predict indoor temperature.
   - Adjust temperature dynamically using AI-based logic.
